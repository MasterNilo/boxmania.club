Almost 2 years ago, I started developing this rhythm game called boxmania.club
These are the main features:
- Oculus Quest and PC compatible (so playable in VR or pancake mode)
- full user access to create custom content (scenery, song maps and even *songs). That was actually the main reason, seeing how gamers had to go through modding and patching tricks to have custom content in similar, popular games. Here you have simple text files to define scenes and maps (maps can also be created in game, generating a text file that can be edited on PC)
- fitness VR gameplay, taking advantage of the 'moving targets feature' (song maps, or player, can move the hit points to different locations so that you have to move around fast). Also a key point, it's fun and good exercise!
- load your own mp3s or *youtube songs. Tired of electronic music? The game works well with rock, metal, pop... even country :) There's an automapper implemented, so customs songs are analysed and a map created on the fly (you can still create and share your own maps, of course)
- *asymmetrical multiplayer/dj mode (one player creates song map in real time, 1 or more other players try to keep up with the beats). Using a common song or youtube clip. This could also be combined with the real time song creation mode

* partially or not implemented yet

Due to reasons, the project was halted and I'm not likely to go on with it, so I've decided to share the source in case someone would like to move it forward or learn how to make a rhythm game (I'm not a guru coder, source as proof :p)

Note that the project won't build as it is, since it needs the following libraries (download/purchase from Unity Asset Store, or replace them with your own, eg. using other vfx lib):

Also removed the songs, you'll need to add your own.

And youtube playtests, creating and playing a song map:

I still think the game has potential. It is actually fun to play! (Also great as a VR fitness game)
